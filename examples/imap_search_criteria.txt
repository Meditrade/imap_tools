# -------------------------------------------------#
#  Here are examples of different search criteria  #
# -------------------------------------------------#

#  Return all messages.
allMsgs = "ALL"

#  Search for already-answered emails.
answered = "ANSWERED"

#  Search for messages on a specific date.
#  The date string is DD-Month-YYYY where Month is
#  Jan, Feb, Mar, Apr, May, Jun, Jul, Aug, Sep, Oct, Nov, or Dec.
onDate = "SENTON 05-Mar-2007"

#  Search for messages between two dates.  SENTBEFORE
#  finds emails sent before a date, and SENTSINCE finds
#  email sent on or after a date.  The "AND" operation
#  is implied by joining criteria, separated by spaces.
betweenDates = "SENTSINCE 01-Mar-2007 SENTBEFORE 05-Mar-2007"

#  Another example of AND: find all unanswered emails
#  sent after 04-Mar-2007 with "Problem" in the subject:
complexSearch1 = "UNANSWERED SENTSINCE 04-Mar-2007 Subject \"Problem\""

#  Find messages with a specific string in the body:
bodySearch = "BODY \"problem solved\""

#  Using OR.  The syntax is OR <criteria1> <criteria2>.
#  The "OR" comes first, followed by each criteria.
#  For example, to match all emails with "Help" or "Question" in the subject.
#  You'll notice that literal strings may be quoted or unquoted.
#  If a literal contains SPACE characters, quote it:
orSearch = "OR SUBJECT Help SUBJECT Question"

#  Strings are case-insensitive when searching....
#  ----------------------------------------------

#  Find all emails sent from yahoo.com addresses:
fromSearch = "FROM yahoo.com"
#  Find all emails sent from anyone with "John" in their name:
johnSearch = "FROM John"

#  Find emails with the RECENT flag set:
recentSearch = "RECENT"

#  Find emails that don't have the recent flag set:
notRecentSearch = "NOT RECENT"
#  This is synonymous with "OLD":
oldSearch = "OLD"

#  Find all emails marked for deletion:
markedForDeleteSearch = "DELETED"

#  Find all emails having a specified header field with a value
#  containing a substring:
headerSearch = "HEADER DomainKey-Signature paypal.com"

#  Find any emails having a specific header field.  If the
#  2nd argument to the "HEADER" criteria is an empty string,
#  any email having the header field is returned regardless
#  of the header field's content.
#  Find any emails with a DomainKey-Signature field:
headerExistsSearch = "HEADER DomainKey-Signature \"\""

#  Find NEW emails: these are emails that have the RECENT flag
#  set, but not the SEEN flag:
newSearch = "NEW"

#  Find emails larger than a certain number of bytes:
sizeLargerSearch = "LARGER 500000"

#  Find emails marked as seen or not already seen:
seenSearch = "SEEN"
notSeenSearch = "NOT SEEN"

#  Find emails having a given substring in the TO header field:
toSearch = "TO support@chilkatsoft.com"
#  A more long-winded way to do the same thing:
toSearch2 = "HEADER TO support@chilkatsoft.com"

#  Find emails smaller than a size in bytes:
smallerSearch = "SMALLER 30000"

#  Find emails that have a substring anywhere in the header
#  or body:
fullSubstringSearch = "TEXT \"Zip Component\""
